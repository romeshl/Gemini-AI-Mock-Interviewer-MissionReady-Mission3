# Intro

In this project I'm using [Google Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/) to create an interview simulation app. 

When the user types a **Job title** in the input box and press **Start Interview**, the interview starts. 

The AI is configured to ask 2 questions in the interview and will provide feedback at the end. You can change the **NUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS** constant in the *App.tsx* to modify the number of questions asked by the AI.

I've used the **systemInstruction** property to set the behavior of the AI. (More information can be found at [systemInstructions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/system-instructions?lang=node))
